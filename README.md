I am selecting the amount of memory (RAM) in megabytes to be allocated to the virtual machine as per the recommendation. You can increase the size as per your choice and click Next>.

Choose whether the new virtual hard disk file should grow as it is used (dynamically allocated) or if it should be created at its maximum size (fixed size). Here I have clicked on Dynamically allocated so that i don’t have to face the issue if my file grows.After that click Next>.

Select the size of the virtual hard disk in megabytes. This size is the limit on the amount of file data that a virtual machine will be able to store on the hard disk and click Create>.
